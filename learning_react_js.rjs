                            Enabling ES6 and JSX

We recommend using React with Babel to let you use ES6 and JSX in your JavaScript code. ES6 is a set of modern JavaScript features that make development easier, and JSX is an extension to the JavaScript language that works nicely with React.


so install babel with babel-preset-react and babel-preset-env and enable them in your .babelrc configuration, and youâ€™re good to go.

Choose your tool (try CLI)

    react is a javascipt library
    react uses webpaack a module bundler that makes things easier to deal with
    uses jsx (a mix of js and html) and ecmascript2015, (modern version of js)
    however some browsers do not support this, babel is a complier that converts it to raw js

to hard to install so I'll use the big external file instead

















https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html

                            ----------starting with react.js--------

    ReactDOM.render(
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>,
      document.getElementById('root')
    );

    react programs go in a js file


                                -------Introducing JSX-----------

    const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
    
is known as jsx

react doesn't need jsx but its helpful when you need to find errors


        --Embedding Expressions in JSX--

to embed js in jsx use curly braces

    { [js] }

also use parentheses around these braces to avoid semicolon insertions


you can use JSX for conditionals functions and so on
